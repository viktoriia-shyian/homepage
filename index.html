              <!-- Experience -->
              <b>Early life</b>
              <p>Van Gogh was born on March 30, 1853, to upper middle class parents. He spent his early adulthood
                working
                for a firm of
                art dealers before traveling to The Hague, London and Paris.

                He was deeply religious as a younger man and aspired to be a pastor, like his father. He became a
                teacher
                in England and
                then he worked as a missionary in a mining region in Belgium where he sketched people from the local
                community, and in
                1885 painted his first major work The Potato Eaters. His palette then consisted mainly of somber earth
                tones and showed
                no sign of the vivid coloration that distinguished his later paintings.</p>

              <b>France</b>
              <p>In March 1886, he moved to Paris and discovered the French Impressionists. He met many artists
                including
                Degas,
                Toulouse-Lautrec, Pissarro and Gauguin, with whom he became friends. Later, he moved to the south of
                France and was
                influenced by the region's strong sunlight. His paintings grew brighter in color, and he developed the
                unique and highly
                recognizable style that became fully realized during his stay in Arles in 1888.

                Van Gogh invited Gauguin to join him in Arles, but their relationship began to deteriorate. Van Gogh
                admired Gauguin and
                desperately wanted to be treated as his equal, but Gauguin was arrogant and domineering, something that
                often frustrated
                Van Gogh. They quarreled about art; Van Gogh increasingly feared that Gauguin was going to desert him,
                and
                the
                situation, which Van Gogh described as one of "excessive tension," rapidly headed towards a crisis
                point.
                Deeply
                remorseful, he then cut off part of his own ear.</p>


              <b>Mental illness</b>
              <p>This incident was the first serious sign of the mental health problems that were to afflict Van Gogh
                for
                the remaining
                days of his life. He spent time in psychiatric hospitals and swung between periods of inertia,
                depression
                and incredibly
                concentrated artistic activity. His work reflected the intense colours and strong light of the
                countryside
                around him.
                On May 9, 1889, he asked to be admitted to the asylum at Saint-Rémy-de Provence, a hospital for the
                mentally ill. In the
                year Van Gogh spent at the asylum he worked as much as he had at Arles, producing 150 paintings and
                hundreds of
                drawings.</p>



              <b>Death</b>
              <p>Van Gogh went to Paris on May 17, 1890, to visit his brother, Theo. On the advice of Pissarro, Theo had
                Vincent go to
                Auvers, just outside Paris. At first, Van Gogh felt relieved at Auvers, but toward the end of June he
                experienced fits
                of temper and often quarreled with Gachet. On July 27, 1890, he shot himself in a lonely field and died,
                two days later,
                in the morning of July 29, 1890.</p>



              <b>Brother Theo</b>
              <p>The most comprehensive primary source for understanding Van Gogh is the collection of letters between
                him
                and his
                younger brother, art dealer Theo van Gogh. They lay the foundation for most of what is known about his
                thoughts and
                beliefs.Theo provided his brother with financial and emotional support. The brother's lifelong
                friendship,
                and most of
                what is known of Vincent's thoughts and theories of art, is recorded in the hundreds of letters
                exchanged
                between 1872
                and 1890. There are more than 600 from Vincent to Theo, and 40 from Theo to Vincent.</p>

                    months before his death. His most expensive painting Portrait of Dr. Gachet was sold for $148.6
