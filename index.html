                  <b>In less than 10 years, painted almost 900 paintings</b>
                  <p>From November 1881 to July 1890, produced close to 900 paintings. He used peasants and farmers as
                    models
                    and then flowers, landscapes and himself because he was too poor to pay his subjects.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>A prolific correspondent</b>
                  <p>Wrote nearly as many letters as created paintings: composed nearly 800 letters, mainly to brother
                    and
                    closest friend Theo.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>Only one painting sold during lifetime</b>
                  <p>He sold only one painting while he was alive: The Red Vineyard which went for 400 francs in Belgium
                    seven
                    months before his death. His most expensive painting Portrait of Dr. Gachet was sold for $148.6
                    million
                    in 1990.</p>

                  <b>Only the lobe, not the whole ear was cut off</b>
                  <p>Actually, Gauguin lopped off his friend’s lobe while they were fencing and the self-mutilation was
                    concocted between the two to avoid embarrassment and arrest.</p>
